# FSTMLP

**To facilitate reviewers to verify the performance of our proposed method, we will provide test and model codes immediately after the first review.**

We provide here the results of our model prediction error tests in the UNIV scenario with and without noise.

We provide the prediction error test results and model parameters for the ETH, HOTEL, UNIV, ZARA1, and ZARA2 scenarios.

**The proposed method achieves accurate and reliable predictions at minimal computational cost**




See you later!
